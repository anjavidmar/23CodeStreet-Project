				<h1>About</h1>

				<h2>About Us</h2>
				
				<p>We are the class of September 2016 of 23 Code Street:</p>

				<ul>
					<li class="indent">Mina Begum</li>
					<li class="indent">Rachel Griffiths</li>
					<li class="indent">Tasha Nassbaum</li>
					<li class="indent">Amber Parkin </li>
					<li class="indent">Anja Vidmar</li>
				</ul>
				
				<p>Assisted in the build of this website by:</p>
				
				<ul>
					<li class="indent">Kate Alexander - our brilliant lead teacher!</li>
					<li class="indent">Anisah Osman Britton - the amazing founder of 23 Code Street</li>
				</ul>

				<p>
					We are the first cohort of 23 Code Street, a coding school for women where for every paying student we teach a disadvantaged woman in India how to code and help her get into work.
				</p>
				<p>
					As part of 23 Code Street, we were introduced to women in the slum who’s skills are being exploited and we decided we wanted to create a shop that would create a source of fair revenue and expose their talent to our community.
				</p>

				<h2>About The Makers</h2>
				
				<p>
					Our products are all handmade in the biggest slum in Asia- The infamous Dharavi Slum in Mumbai, India. Although structurally illegal, Dharavi is home to over more than a million people. It’s also an incredible centre of creativity- from leathers, jewellery, embroidery, clothing, food and much more, Dharavi is an economic hub with small scale industry thriving in the area.
				</p>
				<p>
					It’s not just the independent factories though. Individuals create and sell beautiful and intricate products from jewellery, to bags, to home made remedies.
				</p>
				<p>
					We are working with women who want to create a better, independent life for themselves and their families. We are working closely with a small group of women to create cases for devices full of beauty, personality and story. Each item will come with the proud of it’s origins and maker.
